Created an app using BrightScript and Scenegraph for the Roku Design Challenge. The app, a brain teaser inclusive to kids aged 4-8, features levels where kids explore historical eras and answer questions. Expanded on the app during a summer internship, enhancing the design to be more functional and practical for special needs kids.
